A script to cheat at "License To Spell" (https://www.seattlephysicstutor.com/plates.html)

This script performs a very simple function: Find the shortest (and within words of that length, alphabetically first) word that contains three input letters in the order given.

There are some other important rules (output words must be at least 4 letters long), but that's the general idea. The default dictionary for the website is Collins Scrabble Words '21, but as this is a copyrighted list, it is not being distributed in this repo.

## Examples

| Input | Output |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| sfk | SIFAKA |
| xds | OXIDS |
| rtg | RETAG |
| lqv | COLLIQUATIVE |
| boy | BODY |
